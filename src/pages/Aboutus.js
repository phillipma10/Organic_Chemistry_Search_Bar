Aaron and Phillip worked on the functionality and styling of the website, Hannah worked on grouping the 60+ reactions, importing the images on the site, and making the logo, and Mario and Kaitlyn worked on the descriptions and images. We were going to make a Godâ€™s Plan remix video of chemical reactions (we already made some rhymes too), but we thought that this would be more useful for Chem 14D students. Enjoy! </p>
